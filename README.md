This is a simple menu I created for servers that want to keep it easy for new players to find cars.

I've added LEO departments and a fire department but if you want to only add civ vehicles it's not that difficult just follow how the code is set up and if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask at in my discord https://discord.gg/Z9Mxu72zZ6 just make sure to look if someone has had the same problem and then you can go ahead and ask :)

Features:
• Easy config
• Multiple departments
• No spawn spamming
• Easy to use
